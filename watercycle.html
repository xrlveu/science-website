		<p> WATER BEHAVIOR IN ITS DIFFERENT STATE<br>
			<br>
			When water is at a solid state, the water molecules are close together, preventing it from changing shape.<br>

			When water is at a liquid state, the water molecules are less close together, taking the shape of its container.<br>

			When water is at a gas state, the water molecules are spread out and have more energy, resulting it to move rapidly.<br>
			<br>
			WATER CYCLE<br>
			<br>
			EVAPORATION: Evaporation occurs when the water is in its liquid state, which has a high kinetic energy, causing it to rise up into the water vapor clouds.<br>

			CONDENSATION: The water vapor that came from the atmosphere cools down due to low temperatures, forming into tiny droplets, which eventually forms clouds.<br>

			PRECIPITATION: Precipation occurs when water vapors attach itself into certain particle surfaces, causing it to be heavy, then dropping out of the cloud and below. <br>

			COLLECTION: Collection occurs when precipitation releases fresh water back to Earth, collecting water in the bodies of water such as lakes, streams, and rivers.<br></p>
